# **Building "MarketPulse": A Competitive Intelligence Knowledge Base with AWS Bedrock**

## **Introduction**

In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, staying informed about your competitors, market trends, and industry developments is crucial for strategic decision-making. In this tutorial, we'll use AWS Bedrock to create "MarketPulse" \- a knowledge base that continuously crawls the web to gather competitive intelligence for your business.

## **What is MarketPulse?**

MarketPulse is a knowledge base built on AWS Bedrock that automatically:

* Crawls industry news sites, competitor blogs, and product pages

## **Tutorial Steps**

### **Step 1: Set Up AWS Bedrock Access**

1. Sign in to your AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to AWS Bedrock
3. Request access to foundation models you plan to use (Claude, Amazon Titan, etc.)
4. Once approved, verify access by testing basic model invocation

### **Step 2: Define Your Knowledge Base Focus**

1. Identify your primary competitors and industry news sources
2. Create a document listing URLs to crawl, organized by categories:
    * Competitor websites
    * Industry publications
    * Financial reports
    * Product review sites
    * Social media feeds (where applicable)

### **Step 3: Create a Knowledge Base in Bedrock**

1. In the AWS Bedrock console, navigate to "Knowledge bases"
2. Click "Create knowledge base"
3. Enter "MarketPulse" as the name
4. Add an appropriate description like "Competitive intelligence knowledge base for \[your industry\]"
5. Select your preferred foundation model (Claude or Amazon Titan recommended for comprehensive understanding)

### **Step 4: Configure Data Sources**

1. Under "Data sources," select "Web crawler"
2. Configure the crawler with:
    * URLs from your prepared list
    * Crawl depth (recommend starting with 2-3 levels)
    * Crawl frequency (daily or weekly depending on how rapidly your industry changes)
    * Access permissions (if needed for password-protected sites)
3. Set up content filters to exclude irrelevant information
4. Configure language settings based on your target markets

### **Step 5: Set Up Data Processing**

1. Configure how Bedrock should process and index the content:
    * Text extraction settings
    * Data chunking parameters
    * Metadata extraction (dates, authors, titles)
2. Set up synonyms and custom vocabulary for your industry
3. Configure semantic search settings for optimal retrieval

### **Step 6: Deploy and Test Your Knowledge Base**

1. Review all settings and click "Create knowledge base"
2. Wait for initial crawl and indexing to complete (this may take several hours)
3. Once ready, navigate to the "Query" section
4. Test with questions like:
    * "What new products has \[Competitor\] launched in the last 3 months?"
    * "What pricing changes have occurred in our market recently?"
    * "Summarize the latest regulatory changes affecting our industry"
    * "What are customers saying about \[Competitor Product\] vs our offering?"

### **Step 7: Integrate with Business Applications**

1. Use AWS Bedrock API to integrate MarketPulse with:
    * Internal dashboards
    * CRM systems
    * Business intelligence tools
    * Email alert systems
2. Set up scheduled reports for regular competitive insights

### **Step 8: Optimize and Maintain**

2. Adjust crawling parameters based on information quality
3. Add or remove sources as your competitive landscape changes
4. Update custom vocabulary as industry terminology evolves

## **Best Practices**

1. **Ethical Crawling**: Respect robots.txt files and website terms of service
2. **Data Freshness**: Balance crawl frequency with content change rates
3. **Query Formulation**: Train your team to ask specific questions for better results
4. **Supplemental Sources**: Consider adding manual uploads for paywalled content or proprietary data
